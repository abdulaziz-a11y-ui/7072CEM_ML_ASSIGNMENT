# 7072CEM Machine Learning Assignment

This repository contains the full implementation of the machine learning pipeline used for my 7072CEM coursework.

## Contents
- Preprocessing script (`preprocess.py`)
- PCA transformation and model training notebooks
- Figures and plots (confusion matrices, PCA results)
- Appendix and source code used in the scientific paper

## Dataset
UCI Daily and Sports Activities Dataset  
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/256/daily+and+sports+activities)

## Overview
The project includes:
- Loading and parsing activity sensor files
- Flattening multivariate time-series matrices into feature vectors
- Standardisation using StandardScaler
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA (50 components)
- Training ML models (SVM, KNN, Random Forest)
- Evaluation using accuracy, F1-score and confusion matrices
